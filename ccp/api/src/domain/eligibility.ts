 *   L3 (final approver) → `lead` only
 * `isAdmin` is deliberately never consulted (ADR-0011: admin is a capability, not an
 * approval seniority). This is the single ENFORCEMENT point the approve handler gates the
 * NEXT step on — but as of ARCH-8, no longer a separate DEFINITION of the rule: this
 * re-exports the app's `lib/approvalLadder.ts#canSignApprovalStep` through the `@app-lib`
 * seam (ARCH-6's checked boundary — see `test/appLibBoundary.test.ts`) instead of
 * hand-mirroring it, so the SPA's ladder display and the server's actual gate can no
 * longer independently drift the way ARCH-7's status vocabulary did.

/**
 * 0021 F2/G2 — "eligible approver" counted too broadly. `requests.ts` used to filter
 * the GLOBAL directory (`config.ts:loadAccounts`) by role, `status==='active'`, and
 * `≠ requester` only — NOT by project binding (enforced everywhere else,
 * `projects.ts:isBoundToProject`) and NOT by activation (`mustChangePassword`, `totp`
 * unset). This is the single shared source of truth for "does this account count as a
 * candidate signer for this request", used ONLY by G5 feasibility surfacing now (0037
 * removed the interim single-approver profile that also read it).
 *
 * Tier-INDEPENDENT by design (0037): a candidate signer is any project-bound, activated
 * approver-or-lead who isn't the requester — because every ladder's L2 step admits
 * approver-or-lead. WHETHER the ladder can actually COMPLETE (its L3 step needs a lead)
 * is `computeFeasibility`'s job, which splits this set by role.
 *
 * PER-PROJECT (0014 dim-5): the role is now the caller's role ON `projectId`
 * (`roleFor`). A defined approver/lead result IS proof of membership, so the separate
 * `isBoundToProject` call is gone — an account senior on project A but only a requester
 * (or a non-member) on B cannot sign B's requests.
