# Fix log

One entry per finding marked `fixed:` in [`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md), with that finding's
definition-of-done worked through honestly.

**The gate requires this.** A finding cannot be marked `fixed:` without a `## <ID>` section
here — that is what stops "fixed" from becoming a word someone types. Where a
definition-of-done item is *not* satisfied, the box stays unticked and the entry says why,
rather than being rounded up.

Entry format — `## <finding id>`, then the six boxes, then any residue:

```
## CI-2

- [x] Defect reproduced first
...
**Residue:** anything the fix deliberately leaves behind.
```

## IMP-7

*Azure template provider pin (4.14.0) contradicts the committed azurerm schemadump tag it
claims to bind to.* Fixed by `661d247` (PR #7), not by this branch — recorded here because
the finding is marked closed and the reasoning needs to be auditable.

- [x] **Defect reproduced first** — confirmed against the tree at `3000920`:
      `templates/versions.tf:17` and `run-aztfexport.sh:26` both read `4.14.0` while the only
      committed dump was `azurerm-v4.81.0-schema.json`.
- [x] **Cause, not symptom** — both pins moved to 4.81.0, matching the audited dump. All four
      copies now agree (`versions.tf`, `run-aztfexport.sh`, `gen.sh:45-46`,
      `forcenewShared.ts:26`), verified by reading each.
- [ ] **Regression test** — **not satisfied.** Nothing compares the template pin to the
      committed dump filename. The pins can silently diverge again tomorrow.
- [x] **Failure is loud** — n/a for this fix; no runtime check is involved.
- [x] **Evidence in the status line** — `661d247`.
- [x] **Lesson recorded** — L-3, on separating mechanical re-anchoring from judgement.

**Residue:** the finding's own recommendation had two branches and only the first landed.
The divergence is gone; the *recurrence guard* is not. This is exactly the shape the
definition of done says should stay open — it is marked `fixed` because the defect as
stated (the two pins contradicting the dump) is genuinely resolved, but a follow-up
finding should be opened for the missing guard. **Not currently tracked by any finding id.**

## CI-2

*PG-9 (gitleaks) is a silent no-op in CI: the pinned v8.18.4 has no `dir` subcommand, and
the script converts the failure into a pass.*

- [x] **Defect reproduced first** — downloaded gitleaks v8.18.4, confirmed
      `gitleaks dir --help` exits non-zero with `unknown command "dir"`, then ran
      `publish-gate.sh` against it and watched PG-9 record **PASS 0** while scanning nothing.
- [x] **Cause, not symptom** — the version pin was the trigger; the cause was
      `>/dev/null 2>&1` plus never reading the exit status. Bumping the pin alone would have
      left the next wrong pin, unreadable config, or CLI change equally silent. The script
      now treats any non-zero status as a hard PG-9 failure, since `--exit-code 0` means
      findings cannot be what moved it.
- [x] **Regression test** — the CI install step now asserts `gitleaks dir --help` succeeds
      and fails the step with an explicit message otherwise, so a bad pin cannot reach PG-9.
      Verified to trip: with v8.18.4 on PATH the gate reports
      `PG-9 FAIL 1 — gitleaks invocation failed (exit 1)` and prints gitleaks' stderr.
      *Honest limit:* this is a CI assertion, not a unit test in a suite — `publish-gate.sh`
      has no test harness to hang one on.
- [x] **Failure is loud** — the entire point of the fix. Three paths verified: working
      gitleaks → `PASS 0`; v8.18.4 → `FAIL` with stderr surfaced; gitleaks absent → `SKIP`,
      preserving the existing graceful degradation.
- [x] **Evidence in the status line** — pin ≥ v8.19.0 plus the hard-fail on invocation
      failure.
- [x] **Lesson recorded** — L-1.

**Residue:** two things, both deliberate.

1. Running the scanner for the first time surfaced 4 hits. All four are genuine
   placeholders — three are the audit's own PG-5 probe values, one is PG-4's published AKIA
   example set — and are allowlisted in `.gitleaks.toml` with the reason each is safe. No
   real secret was found. Worth knowing that the allowlist is now load-bearing in a way it
   was not while PG-9 scanned nothing.
2. **CI-8 is only half-addressed and stays open.** It has two halves: PG-5's regex misses
   common shapes, *and* its designated backstop does not run. The backstop now runs, and
   demonstrably catches all three shapes PG-5 misses. PG-5's regex is still weak, so the
   finding is not closed.
